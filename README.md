# SlimeRPG2

SlimeRPG2 is a text-based role-playing game where you just kill slimes, the most iconic enemy in pretty much any kind of RPG.
The original SlimeRPG is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/CrazyGuy108/5dfca977d6ac24ad4620) I made a long time ago when I was first learning C++. 
After about a year I've now decided to rewrite, maintain, and improve this game.
