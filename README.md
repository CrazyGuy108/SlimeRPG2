# SlimeRPG2

SlimeRPG2 is a text-based role-playing game where you just kill slimes, the most iconic enemy in pretty much any kind of RPG.
The original SlimeRPG is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/CrazyGuy108/5dfca977d6ac24ad4620) I made a long time ago when I was first learning C++.

## Things I learned
I didn't do a whole lot here, but I did get better at using C++ and developing the story of a game.
